# Resume
Resume constructed from HTML and CSS

The task is to make something that looks like a resume, have as much fun as you want with it, or be as rough and incomplete as you need to, but do it in HTML. The point is not the resume, the point is to speak a little bit of computer language and tell your machine how to display something specifically, then experience your machine following your orders!

Requirements
Create an HTML file
Add HTML content to the file so that it looks resume-ish
Upload that .html file to the ⁠Pre-work Submissions topic.
Feel free to anonymize the information as you see fit.
Feel free to have as much fun with the “resume” as you want

Hard Mode
Style your Resume with CSS.
You did that already? See, you’re good at this.
Too overwhelmed? That’s why its in the hard mode section.

Extra Hard Mode
Instead of uploading an HTML file to the discord, host the page somewhere and post a link to the public website.
No cheating and using no code tools here. If you’re posting a link, also post a link to where you've hosted/we can see the HTML and CSS you wrote.
